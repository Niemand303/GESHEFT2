 g_ussr.1.t:0 "The Passing of the Supreme Soviet"
 g_ussr.1.d:0 "Few men have been so influential on a world scale during the 20th century as Josef Vissarionovich Stalin. Stalin was the de facto leader of the Soviet Union from the mid-1920s until his death in 1953. Josef Stalin was appointed General Secretary of the Soviet Communist Party in 1922 where he, Lenin and Trotsky ruled supreme in the old czarist empire. Josef Stalin died in March 1953: officially of a cardiac failure, although it has also been rumored that he was the victim of a murder plot engineered by Lavrenti Beria. The truth will probably never be known, but after Stalin's death Beria was arrested. Beria was tried by a special tribunal without the possibility of appeal and he was found guilty, sentenced to death, and soon executed."

 g_ussr.2.t:0 "Stalin's Successors"
 g_ussr.2.d:0 "After Stalin died in March 1953, there was a period of uncertainty over the succession in the highest circles of power. On paper, Stalin was succeeded by Nikita Khrushchev as the Party's First Secretary and Georgi Malenkov as Premier. However the central figure in the immediate post-Stalin period was the former head of the state security apparatus, Lavrentiy Beria. Beria, despite his record as part of Stalin's terror state, initiated a period of relative liberalization, including the release of some political prisoners. The leadership also began allowing some criticism of Stalin, saying that his one-man dictatorship went against the principles laid down by Lenin. Historically, the Politburo members disliked and feared Beria for his role under Stalin and with the support of the armed forces, had him arrested three months after Stalin's death.  In the post-Beria period, Khrushchev rapidly began to emerge as the key figure. Who will be appointed as Stalin's successor?"

His successor may be able to rein them in again, using full force of the army and security apparatus but there is always a possibility that things go out of control completely.\n\n Baltic states declared unilateral independence from Moscow."

 g_ussr.13.d:0 "On 26 June 1953, Beria was arrested and held in an undisclosed location near Moscow. Accounts of Beria's fall vary considerably. By the most likely account, Khrushchev prepared an elaborate ambush, convening a meeting of the Presidium on 26 June, where he suddenly launched a scathing attack on Beria, accusing him of being a traitor and spy in the pay of British intelligence. Beria was taken completely by surprise. Molotov and others quickly spoke against Beria one after the other, followed by a motion by Khrushchev for his instant dismissal. When Beria finally realized what was happening and plaintively appealed to Malenkov to speak for him, his old friend and crony silently hung his head and refused to meet his gaze. Malenkov pressed a button on his desk as the pre-arranged signal to Marshal Georgy Zhukov and a group of armed officers in a nearby room. They burst in and arrested Beria. \n\n Beria was sentenced to death on 23 December 1953. He was shot through the forehead by General Pavel Batitsky. The body of Lavrentiy Pavlovich Beria was subsequently cremated. The remains were buried in a forest near Moscow."

These two documents were confirmed by the 1st Congress of Soviets of the USSR and signed by the heads of the delegations, Mikhail Kalinin, Mikhail Tskhakaya, Mikhail Frunze, Grigory Petrovsky, and Alexander Chervyakov, on 30 December 1922.

In September 1943, Iran declared war on Germany, which qualified it for membership in the United Nations (UN).

The Soviets not only violated the March 2 withdrawal deadline; in that time they had expanded their military presence southward. By mid-December 1945, with the use of troops and secret police, they had set up two pro-Soviet "People's Democratic Republics" within Iranian territory, the Azerbaijan People's Republic headed by Sayyid Jafar Pishevari and the Kurdish Republic of Mahabad under President Pesheva Qazi Muhammad."

Foreign policy was a main issue in the race for the Republican nomination.

American military force was usually not involved, but Congress appropriated free gifts of financial aid to support the economies and the militaries of Greece and Turkey. More generally, the Truman Doctrine implied American support for other nations threatened by Soviet communism. The Truman Doctrine became the foundation of American foreign policy, and led, in 1949, to the formation of NATO, a military alliance that is still in effect.
